* I use [LC time tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RCb1dVQCLmtOGlJ5J-NJ5pIC7Tda-N2U/edit#gid=274831950) to keep track of how many times I solves a question and how long I spent each time. Once I finish non-trivial medium LC questions 3 times, I have absolutely no issues solving them in actual interviews (sometimes within 8-10 minutes). It makes a big difference. A better way is to use LeetPlug chrome extension [here](https://leetplug.azurewebsites.net/static/pages/howto.html)

* This [Leetcode post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/665604/important-and-useful-links-from-all-over-the-leetcode/659097) combines 36 tips and tricks in improving Leetcode problem solving skills.
